## What is it?

`obscurer` gives your HTTP API the ability to utilize obscure URLs, which
provides additional abstraction that is beneficial when implementing
level 3 RESTful APIs.

### What are obscure URLs?

Typically when creating a RESTful API using HTTP, the API defines URLs that
provide a predictable structure. For example, an API with a `product` resource
might have `/api/products/1/` URL path, where `1` is the ID of the product
being interacted with.

When creating [level 3][level-3-apis] hypermedia APIs, the API is responsible
for defining and managing the state of an application through links. As such,
any time a consumer is able to bypass this responsibility by issuing a
request to a URL that it wasn't given in the response of a previous request,
it actually undermines what a hypermedia API represents.

To prevent URLs from being "hackable" (or guessable), we obscure them. A
common method involves taking the normal URL path and running it through
a simple hashing algorithm, such as [MD5][md5]. These obscured URLs are then
returned to consumers in response representations, that they then use to issue
additional downstream requests.

## Why use it?

- can be extended to support any store of your choice (Redis, MySQL, etc.).
- immediately compatible with any request multiplexer.
- increased privacy of API interfaces.
- reduced "hackability" of API interfaces, promoting loose coupling.
- side-by-side support for unobscured and obscured URLs.
- automatically discards obscured URLs resulting in HTTP 404.

## How do I use it?

### Quickstart

```go
// create your mux.
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("/this/is/the/way", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Println("i'm mando!")
})

// choose your store. ðŸŽ‰
store := obscurer.DefaultStore

// choose your obscurer. ðŸŽ‰
obscurer := obscurer.Default

// add obscured URL support. ðŸŽ‰
handler := obscurer.NewHandler(obscurer, store, mux)

// create your server.
server := &http.Server{
	Addr: ":8080",
	Handler: handler, // ðŸŽ‰
}

// start your server!
log.Fatal(server.ListenAndServe())
```
